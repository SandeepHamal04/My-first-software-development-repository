# My-first-software-development-repository
This software repository contains my first software for the module Software Development. It stores all of the related files including a README file which contains information about the software I have written

My name is Mr. Sandeep hamal and I am a student at University of Law. I am using GitHub to share my projects collaboratively with the rest of the world. 
I am not a software developer now but eventually I will be one and I will make many system software that solves the real-world problems. My aim is to build a system software and open my own business one day. 
In the class of Software Development unit 2, I have learned about the "Software Versioning" which is the practice of assigning unique identifiers (versions) to software releases, allowing developers to track changes, manage updates, and maintain multiple software versions. I have also learned about the versioning technology such as version, releease, revision, etc. and semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch). I also learned about benefits, types of software versioning. Other a commit messages and tags, branching,  and merging changes was also included in the course.
